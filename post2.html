      <p>Here is the truth: coding is like dating. At first, everything is confusing, you overthink every move, and Google becomes your therapist &#128522;.</p>

      <p>Some days I feel like a genius, other days I forget a semicolon and my whole site collapses 💀. But that is the fun, right? Growth, chaos, and tiny wins that feel massive.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>&#9749; Fuel: coffee (obviously)</li>
        <li>&#128187; Tools: VS Code, a browser, and vibes</li>
        <li>&#128221; Notes: Do not panic. Refresh fixes a lot.</li>
      </ul>

        “Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it is bad.” 😂

      <p>I am not perfect, but I am consistent. And honestly? That is how people win at this game &#127942;.</p>
