    <h2>Hi there, just to introduce myself again I am Sammy &#128075;</h2> <!-- waving hand -->
    <p>Welcome to my little corner of the web. I made this site from scratch to share my thoughts, projects, and writing. This helps me clear my head and it is also a fun hobby of mine. &#128150;.</p>
    <p>I am currently a student learning computer science and building cool things one step at a time. Writing is how I process, reflect, and connect &#128221;.</p>
    <p>Stick around, and you will see posts about my journey, ideas, and whatever is on my mind &#127752;.</p>
